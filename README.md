# that-c-sharp-guy
New blog. Cool.

This is the repository where I keep the template for my blog (written in Jekyll) “That C# guy”, if you haven’t visited it yet I strongly advice you [to do so](http://thatcsharpguy.com).  
  
## Why?  
The real question is *why not?*  
  
## What can I find here?
As I mentioned before, here you can find all the source code for the complete blog minus draft posts, the draft posts are kept in an **ultra secret** repository because… reasons.

## Can I use some (or all) of this stuff?  
Well, as the blog pages state: unless otherwise stated anything is “CC Attribution 4.0 International”-licensed so, yeah. You can do so.
