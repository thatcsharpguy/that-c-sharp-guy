At school I was often asked to write small console apps to practice programming concepts, and some teachers even wanted a fully functional project in that way.  

But what happens when we face real people/world problems? for sure, there are still console apps out in the wild, but nowadays all the successful applications have a mobile version, why yours shouldn't have one.

In this post I'll try to show you how to go from console to mobile with a simple example, it's a bit long but I'll make it worth the reading.
