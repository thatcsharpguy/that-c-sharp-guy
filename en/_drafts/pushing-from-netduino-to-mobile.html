excerpt: He de aceptarlo, una de las cosas que más dudas me causaba cuando inicié a programar usando C# era sobre cuál era la diferencia entre usar string o System.String, la idea que yo tenía al respecto que estaba totalmente equivocada.

It's been a while since I took my Netduino out of its box and I did something with it, back then I promised to do a slightly more complex system using a push notification service. I quote my own words: *"I'll create a system that sends a notification over to my phone everytime someone opens my bedroom door"*. Well, here it is.  

## On Parse  
Parse is a BaaS (Backend as a service) providers that amongst its set of features offers a Push Notifications service. I will be using that service to send the push notifications to my devices.  
First of all, I headed over to Parse.com, signed up for a free account and created a new app. 

## Setting up the Netduino  

### The `parse-dotnetmf` library  
To consume Parse's REST Api features from a Netduino 3 I decided to create a client library to make things easier for me and possibly you, this library currently only supports sending push notifications to Parse, but can easily be extended to support all other features as well. This library is strongly inspired in the MicroTweet library by MattIsenhower

## Setting up the Xamarin.Forms app  


### The `CrossParse` plugin  
Whe we want to deliver platform specific experiences from a Xamarin.Forms app we can use or create a plugin that will let us abstract that functionalities away from each platform to interact with each platform via a common API. I tried to do a plugin to handle all interactions with Parse push but turns out that this isn't as easy as I thought at first. I mean the Parse's Xamarin Components for each platform already support push notifications but there is no abstraction layer to be used with Forms, not to mention that there are some required special steps for each platform that you must manage explicictly in each platform specific project (such as creating an extra class in the Android project, for example).  

So this plugin isn't as useful as I wanted it to be at first but it still helps by providing the mentioned abstraction layer. With this plugin you can subscribe/unsubscribe to channels and handling notifications while the user is in the app. I really hope Parse release a plugin for Forms soon as it is fairly easy to do given they have already have the components.  
  
The Doorduino app uses my plugin.

## What's next?
I just got a nice 37-in-1 sensor box from China so hopefully this kind of posts won't stop. Anyway, feel free to reach out letting me know what topics do you want me to blog about, below is my contact information.
