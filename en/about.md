#### Antonio Feregrino Bolaños
Almost a computer system engineer for the Escuela Superior de Cómputo of the Instituto Poliécnico Nacional (that is in Mexico), passionate about computer science and programming applied to application development (APIs and mobile apps). I particularly like C# language but I believe that the key is to have good ideas, the language you write them isn't as important. Currently I’m a Xamarin Student Ambassador and a programmer-analyst at Heurística Soluciones.
